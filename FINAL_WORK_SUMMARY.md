## Work Completed Today

### Major Improvements
1. **Enhanced Mobile Touch Interaction**
   - Implemented larger touch targets for clock hands
   - Hour hand: 35px touch target (vs 8px visible hand)
   - Minute hand: 25px touch target (vs 6px visible hand)
   - Second hand: 15px touch target (vs 2px visible hand)

2. **Always-Visible Read-Aloud Control**
   - Added floating speaker button next to digital clock
   - Available in both Normal and Interactive modes
   - Proper accessibility attributes (ARIA labels)

3. **Realistic Snap Mode Behavior**
   - Hour hand moves gradually as minutes advance
   - Exact alignment at hour marks when minute is at 12
   - Subtle snap feedback animation

### Critical Bug Fixes
1. **Hour Hand Alignment Issue**
   - Fixed precise positioning at hour marks in snapped mode
   - Enhanced drawInteractiveTime function logic

2. **Hand Interference Resolution**
   - Fixed overlapping hand dragging issues
   - Reduced touch target sizes to minimize overlap
   - Added prevention of multiple simultaneous drags
