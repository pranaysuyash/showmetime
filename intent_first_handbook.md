## Introduction: The Intent-First Methodology

The Intent-First Methodology transforms how teams make decisions by asking one fundamental question before any action: **"What is the real intent behind this, and will our approach create genuine value?"**

### Core Principles

Every Intent-First philosophy shares these fundamental principles:

1. **Investigate Before Acting** - Always understand the underlying need or problem
2. **Value Over Process** - Focus on outcomes, not just following procedures
3. **MVP Mindset** - Start with minimum viable solutions, enhance iteratively
4. **Business Alignment** - Connect every decision to business and user value
5. **Systematic Documentation** - Track decisions and learnings for continuous improvement

### Universal Framework

Each philosophy follows the same 3-phase investigation framework:

**Phase 1: Context Discovery** - Understand the situation, stakeholders, and current state
**Phase 2: Intent Analysis** - Identify the real problem and desired outcomes
**Phase 3: Priority Assessment** - Evaluate impact, effort, and strategic alignment

### How to Use This Handbook

- **Individual Contributors**: Use the AI prompts for immediate decision support
- **Team Leads**: Implement the checklists and review processes
- **Organizations**: Adopt the team integration frameworks and success metrics

## 1. Intent-First Development Philosophy
### "Investigate Intent Before Acting"

**Core Principle:** Before removing, suppressing, or "fixing" any code, feature, or element — whether in a PR, an MVP, or a full production project — investigate the original intent and determine if completing it would create more value than removing it.

#### Universal Investigation Framework

**Phase 1: Context Discovery**
1. Identify the element (code, feature, UI element, database structure, etc.)
2. Search for references across codebase, documentation, user stories, designs
3. Check related systems (UI, backend, DB, third-party integrations)
4. Review history (Git commits, PRs, issue discussions, meeting notes)

**Phase 2: Intent Analysis**
- What user problem was this meant to solve?
- What workflow was this part of?
- Are there similar completed features showing the pattern?
- Would users expect this functionality to work?

**Phase 3: Impact Assessment**
- **User Value**: High/Medium/Low impact on user experience
- **Business Value**: Revenue, retention, or operational impact
- **Technical Effort**: Hours/days/weeks to complete properly
- **Operational Risk**: New monitoring, alerts, data storage, or maintenance overhead

#### Quick Filter
Skip deep analysis if all true:
- No user-facing connection
- No business value identified
- High technical effort required
- No strategic importance
→ **Default to "Document as Technical Debt"**

#### Decision Matrix
| User Value | Technical Effort | Operational Risk | Action |
|------------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| High | Low-Medium | Low | **Complete to MVP immediately** |
| High | High | Low-Medium | **Plan for next sprint/milestone** |
| Medium | Low | Low | **Complete MVP if time permits** |
| Medium | Medium-High | Any | **Document as technical debt** |
| Low | Any | Any | **Consider removal with stakeholder approval** |
| Any | Any | High | **Defer completion until risk mitigated** |

#### Ready-to-Use AI Prompt
```
You are to apply the Intent-First Development Philosophy to the following element.

### Element:
[Paste file path, code snippet, or description]

### Investigation Requirements:
1. **Identify Intent**: Based on code search patterns, documentation, commit history, and similar features, determine what the original purpose was.
2. **Assess Completion Potential**:
   - Would completing this add user or business value?
   - Is there evidence the frontend/backend expected this feature?
   - Could an MVP version be completed quickly?
3. **Risk & Effort**:
   - Technical effort (low/medium/high)
   - Risk to stability/security/performance
   - Operational impact (monitoring, alerts, data growth)
4. **Decision Options**:
   - Complete now (MVP)
   - Plan for full completion
   - Document as technical debt
   - Remove (with stakeholder approval)
5. **Output Format**:
   - **Original Intent**: [summary]
   - **Evidence Found**: [list of references]
   - **Value Assessment**: [user/business impact]
   - **Risk/Effort**: [summary]
   - **Recommendation**: [Complete/Defer/Remove + reasoning]
   - **Next Steps**: [actions]

### Notes:
- Apply this for audits, refactors, or legacy cleanup - not just PRs
- Favor completion over removal when there is clear user/business value
- Limit completion scope to MVP, defer enhancements unless critical
```

#### Key Questions to Always Ask
- **"What feature or improvement is this trying to enable?"**
- **"Was this supposed to be used, or is it truly dead code?"**
- **"What would make this code complete and valuable?"**

---

## 2. Intent-First Testing Philosophy
### "Test What Matters Most First"

**Core Principle:** Before writing, modifying, or removing tests, investigate which user flows, integrations, and failure points are most critical to business success and user experience, then design tests accordingly.

#### Universal Investigation Framework

**Phase 1: Context Discovery**
1. Identify the testing need (new feature, bug fix, refactoring, legacy cleanup, or migration)
2. Map user journeys (critical paths users take through the system)
3. Analyze failure impact (what breaks and who is affected when this component fails?)
4. Review existing coverage (what's already tested, what gaps exist, and what's redundant?)

**Phase 2: Value Analysis**
- What user problem does this code solve?
- What's the business impact if this fails in production?
- How often is this code path executed?
- What's the cost of failure vs cost of comprehensive testing?

**Phase 3: Test Prioritization**
- **Business Impact**: User trust, revenue, compliance
- **Failure Probability**: Historical stability, change frequency
- **Test Effort**: Time to write, maintain, and run
- **Coverage Gap**: Is this a critical untested area?

#### Quick Filter
Skip detailed test planning if all true:
- Low user/business impact if it fails
- Simple, stable code with low change frequency
- Already well-covered by higher-level tests
- High effort to test with minimal additional value
→ **Document as acceptable test debt** in `test-debt.md`

#### Priority Matrix
| Business Impact | Failure Probability | Test Effort | Priority |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| High | High | Low–Medium | **Critical – Test immediately** |
| High | Medium–High | Low–Medium | **High – Test this sprint** |
| Medium | High | Low | **Medium – Test when time permits** |
| High | Any | High | **Evaluate simplified or partial tests** |
| Low | Low | Any | **Skip or use basic smoke test** |

#### MVP Testing Rule
For *Critical* and *High* priority items, always cover:
- Happy path success
- One high-impact failure mode
- Any security, data integrity, or compliance constraint

Leave exhaustive permutations for later unless risk justifies it.

#### Ready-to-Use AI Prompt
```
You are to apply the Intent-First Testing Philosophy to the following component or feature.

### Component/Feature:
[Describe the code/feature that needs testing]

### Investigation Requirements:
1. **Business Context**:
   - What user problem does this solve?
   - What's the business impact if it fails?
   - How frequently is it executed?

2. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Failure probability (high/medium/low)
   - Blast radius if it breaks
   - Key dependencies and integrations

3. **Coverage Analysis**:

   - **Test Priority**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
   - **Recommended Tests**: [types + scope]
   - **MVP Test Plan**: [minimum viable coverage]
   - **Next Steps**: [actions]

### Notes:
- Focus on user-critical paths over implementation details
- Prefer behavior testing over implementation testing
- Include maintenance burden in decision-making
```

#### Key Questions to Always Ask
- **"What user journey breaks if this fails?"**
- **"How much revenue/trust is lost if wrong?"**
- **"Can we test this more efficiently at another level?"**
- **"Will this test still be valuable in 6–12 months?"**
- **"Are we testing behavior, not implementation?"**

---

## 3. Intent-First UX Design Philosophy
### "Design for the Experience, Not the Pixels"

**Core Principle:** Before creating, modifying, or removing any design element, investigate the user's actual needs, workflows, and pain points to ensure every design change has measurable user and business impact.

#### Universal Investigation Framework

**Phase 1: Context Discovery**
1. Identify the design challenge (new feature, usability issue, or aesthetic update)
2. Research existing user behavior (analytics, heatmaps, support tickets, user interviews)
3. Map current user journeys (compare actual usage patterns with intended flows)
4. Analyze design system context (check consistency with existing patterns, components, and accessibility standards)

**Phase 2: User Intent Analysis**
- What task is the user trying to accomplish?
- What's their mental model and expectations?
- Where do users currently struggle or drop off?
- What would success look like from their perspective?
- Does this affect a core or secondary workflow?

**Phase 3: Design Impact Assessment**
- **User Impact**: Improvement in task success, speed, or error rate
- **Business Impact**: Effect on conversion, retention, satisfaction, or compliance
- **Design Effort**: Time to design, validate, and document
- **Technical Complexity**: Development and QA effort, performance implications

#### Quick Filter
Skip detailed design work if all true:
- Purely cosmetic with no measurable usability improvement
- Very low-traffic area with minimal impact
- High implementation complexity for minimal gain
- Recent change with no evidence of user problems
→ **Document as UX debt** in `ux-debt.md`

#### Design Priority Matrix
| User Impact | Business Impact | Implementation Effort | Priority |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|----------|
| High | High | Low–Medium | **Critical – Design immediately** |
| High | Medium | Low–Medium | **High – Include in next design sprint** |
| Medium | High | Low | **Medium – Schedule in upcoming iterations** |
| High | High | High | **Break into MVP + enhancements** |
| Low | Low | Any | **Defer or log as future consideration** |

#### MVP UX Rule
For *Critical* and *High* priority items, ensure MVP includes:
- Ability for users to complete the core task without errors
- Simplified and intuitive flow
- Accessibility compliance for target user groups
- Performance within acceptable limits

Aesthetic refinements, animations, and extended flows can be added in later iterations unless they directly unblock the user.

#### Ready-to-Use AI Prompt

5. **Output Table**:
   | Problem | User Impact | Business Impact | Effort | Recommendation | MVP Scope | Metrics |
   |---------|-------------|----------------|--------|----------------|-----------|---------|

### Notes:
- Prioritize completion of tasks over visual polish
- Validate assumptions with real user testing
- Address accessibility and performance from the start
```

#### Key Questions to Always Ask
- **"What specific user problem does this solve?"**
- **"How will we measure success?"**
- **"Can users with disabilities complete this task?"**
- **"Does it fit our design system, and if not, why?"**
- **"What's the simplest version that improves the experience?"**
- **"Have we validated this with real users?"**

## 4. Intent-First Code Review Philosophy
### "Understand Before You Judge"

**Core Principle:** Before requesting changes or approving code, investigate the problem the code solves, the constraints the author faced, and the broader system context to provide valuable, actionable feedback.

#### Universal Investigation Framework

**Phase 1: Context Discovery**
1. Understand the problem (read linked issues, requirements, or user stories)
2. Review the approach (understand the solution strategy and alternatives considered)
3. Check system impact (how does this change affect other parts of the system?)
4. Assess constraints (time, technical, or business limitations that influenced decisions)

**Phase 2: Intent Analysis**
- What user or business problem is this solving?
- What constraints or requirements influenced the implementation?
- How does this fit into the larger system architecture?
- Were simpler approaches considered and why were they rejected?

**Phase 3: Review Prioritization**
- **Correctness Impact**: Functional reliability and data integrity
- **Security Impact**: Potential vulnerabilities or exposure
- **Performance Impact**: Efficiency, scalability, resource usage
- **Maintainability Impact**: Readability, extensibility, technical debt risk
- **Style Impact**: Alignment with agreed team coding standards

#### Quick Filter
Skip deep review unless one is true:
- Touches authentication, authorization, payment, or data handling
- Changes high-traffic or high-risk code paths
- Introduces a new architectural pattern
- Modifies performance-critical logic
- Removes tests or reduces coverage
→ If none apply: **skim for maintainability & style, don't block unless standards are violated**

#### Review Priority Matrix
| Issue Type | Impact Level | Action Required |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Security/Correctness | Any | **Request changes immediately** |
| Performance | High | **Request changes with benchmarks** |
| Maintainability | High | **Request changes with reasoning** |
| Architecture | Medium–High | **Discuss and suggest alternatives** |
| Style/Preference | Any | **Comment but don't block unless standard** |

#### MVP Review Rule
Always ensure the PR passes three core checks before approval:
1. **Security** – No vulnerabilities or unsafe handling of data
2. **Correctness** – Code works as intended and passes all tests
3. **Maintainability** – Readable, follows team conventions, and won't create unnecessary technical debt

Optimization, micro-performance tweaks, and style perfection are **secondary** unless they block these three.

   - Maintainability

4. **Review Categories**:
   - Blocking issues (must fix)
   - Important issues (should fix)
   - Suggestions (optional)

5. **Output Table**:
   | Category | Issue | Impact | Action Required |
   |----------|-------|--------|-----------------|

### Notes:
- Focus on security, correctness, and maintainability first
- Provide actionable, specific feedback
- Acknowledge well-made decisions
- Ask for clarification if intent is unclear
```

#### Key Questions to Always Ask
- **"What problem is this solving and is the solution appropriate?"**
- **"Are there hidden security or correctness issues?"**
- **"Will future developers understand and maintain this code?"**
- **"Is my feedback specific, actionable, and justified?"**
- **"Have I acknowledged what the author did well?"**

## 5. Intent-First Deployment Philosophy
### "Ship Confidently, Not Just Quickly"

**Core Principle:** Before deploying or rolling back changes, investigate the business impact, operational readiness, and rollback safety to ensure deployments create value while maintaining system reliability.

#### Universal Investigation Framework

**Phase 1: Context Discovery**
1. Understand the change impact (which systems, users, and processes will be affected?)
2. Assess operational readiness (monitoring, alerting, and support preparedness)
3. Verify rollback safety (can we revert cleanly and quickly if needed?)
4. Check dependencies (are all required services, data, and teams ready?)

**Phase 2: Impact Analysis**
- What user experience will change?
- What is the business value and urgency of this deployment?
- Are we operationally prepared to support this change?
- What would failure look like and how would we detect it?

**Phase 3: Deployment Risk Assessment**
- **Business Impact**: Revenue, compliance, user experience
- **Technical Risk**: Complexity, novelty, criticality
- **Rollback Complexity**: Ease and safety of reverting changes
- **Operational Readiness**: Monitoring, alerting, on-call coverage

#### Quick Filter
Delay if any are true:
- Critical monitoring or alerting not configured
- Rollback procedure untested or unclear
- Major dependencies unavailable or unready
- Deployment window overlaps with high-risk events (e.g., peak traffic)
- On-call or core support staff unavailable
→ **Delay until operational requirements are met**

#### Deployment Risk Matrix
| Business Impact | Technical Risk | Rollback Complexity | Deployment Strategy |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| High | Low | Low | **Standard deployment + extra monitoring** |
| High | Medium | Low–Medium | **Staged rollout with feature flags** |
| High | High | Any | **Blue-green deployment + instant rollback** |
| Medium | Low | Low | **Standard deployment** |
| Any | Any | High | **Migration strategy + rollback plan required** |

#### MVP Deployment Rule
Deploy the **smallest safe scope** that delivers the required business value, with the ability to roll back quickly.
Defer non-critical changes to a separate release to reduce complexity and risk.

### Notes:
- Reliability > speed
- Always define rollback triggers
- Monitor both technical & business metrics
```

#### Key Questions to Always Ask
- **"What's the worst-case scenario and are we ready?"**
- **"Can we detect and recover from failure quickly?"**
- **"Is the business value worth the risk?"**
- **"Is the team ready to support this change?"**
- **"What are our rollback triggers?"**
- **"How will we measure success?"**

## 6. Intent-First Data Philosophy
### "Question Data Before Acting on It"

**Core Principle:** Before making decisions based on data or implementing data changes, investigate the data quality, context, and business relevance to ensure insights are accurate, actionable, and aligned with reality.

#### Universal Investigation Framework

**Phase 1: Data Context Discovery**
1. Identify data sources (where does the data originate and how is it collected?)
2. Assess collection methods (look for sampling bias, gaps, or misclassification)
3. Check data lineage (understand transformations, joins, and enrichments)
4. Review business context (identify conditions/events that may influence data trends)

**Phase 2: Intent Analysis**
- What business decision is this data meant to inform?
- Are we looking at the right metrics for the question?
- What assumptions are we making about completeness and accuracy?
- What external or operational factors could influence these numbers?

**Phase 3: Data Reliability Assessment**
- **Completeness**: Is all expected data present?
- **Accuracy**: Are values measured and recorded correctly?
- **Consistency**: Do sources agree and trends align over time?
- **Timeliness**: Is the data current enough for the decision?
- **Relevance**: Does it truly measure what matters for the business question?

#### Quick Filter
Investigate further if any are true:
- Source or collection method recently changed
- Missing data in high-impact periods
- Unexplained spikes/drops without known cause
- Conflicting trends across sources
- No clear decision linked to the data
→ **Validate quality before using in decision-making**

#### Data Decision Matrix
| Data Quality | Business Impact | Decision Urgency | Action |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| High | High | Any | **Proceed with confidence** |
| Medium | High | Low | **Improve data quality first** |
| Medium | High | High | **Proceed with caveats + monitoring** |
| Low | Any | Any | **Do not base decision on this data** |
| High | Low | Any | **Proceed but focus on higher-impact metrics** |

#### MVP Data Rule
Use the **smallest set of high-quality, relevant, and recent** data to make the decision, then deepen analysis or expand scope if needed.
Avoid over-analysis when a decision can be made confidently with less.

## 7. Intent-First Security Philosophy
### "Secure by Understanding, Not by Blocking"

**Core Principle:** Before implementing, modifying, or removing security controls, investigate the actual attack vectors, business risk, and user impact to ensure security measures provide genuine protection while enabling legitimate use.

#### Universal Investigation Framework

**Phase 1: Context Discovery**
1. Identify the security need (threat, vulnerability, compliance requirement, or incident response)
2. Understand the attack surface (what assets, data, or processes need protection?)
3. Assess current controls (what security measures already exist and their effectiveness)
4. Map user workflows (how do legitimate users interact with the system?)

**Phase 2: Threat Analysis**
- What specific threats or attack vectors are we protecting against?
- What's the likelihood and potential impact of these threats?
- Who are the threat actors and what are their capabilities?
- What's the business impact if this security control fails or blocks legitimate use?

**Phase 3: Security Impact Assessment**
- **Threat Severity**: Likelihood and impact of the threat being mitigated
- **Business Risk**: Financial, regulatory, or reputational impact if exploited
- **User Impact**: Effect on legitimate user workflows and experience
- **Implementation Effort**: Complexity, cost, and maintenance overhead

#### Quick Filter
Skip complex security implementation if all true:
- Very low threat probability with minimal potential impact
- Existing controls already provide adequate protection
- High user friction for minimal security benefit
- Compliance requirement can be met with simpler approach
→ **Document as acceptable security risk** in `security-debt.md`

#### Security Priority Matrix
| Threat Severity | Business Risk | User Impact | Priority |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| High | High | Low | **Critical – Implement immediately** |
| High | Medium | Low-Medium | **High – Implement this sprint** |
| Medium | High | Low | **Medium – Plan for next iteration** |
| High | High | High | **Redesign to balance security and usability** |
| Low | Low | Any | **Document risk acceptance** |

#### MVP Security Rule
For *Critical* and *High* priority items, ensure MVP implementation includes:
- Protection against the primary threat vector
- Minimal disruption to legitimate user workflows
- Clear incident detection and response procedures
- Basic logging and monitoring

Advanced features like complex multi-factor flows or extensive audit logging can be added later unless compliance requires them immediately.

#### Ready-to-Use AI Prompt

   | Success Metrics |  |  |

### Notes:
- Balance security effectiveness with user experience
- Consider defense in depth rather than single controls
- Focus on actual threats, not theoretical vulnerabilities
- Ensure controls can be monitored and maintained
```

#### Key Questions to Always Ask
- **"What specific attack vector does this control prevent?"**
- **"How will we know if this security control is effective?"**
- **"What legitimate user activities might this impact?"**
- **"Are there simpler ways to achieve the same security outcome?"**
- **"How will we detect if this control is being bypassed?"**
- **"What's the business justification for this level of security?"**

## 8. Intent-First Performance Philosophy
### "Optimize What Users Actually Feel"

**Core Principle:** Before implementing performance optimizations, investigate real user impact and business metrics to ensure efforts improve actual user experience rather than synthetic benchmarks.

#### Universal Investigation Framework

**Phase 1: Context Discovery**
1. Identify performance concerns (user complaints, monitoring alerts, or proactive optimization)
2. Measure current user experience (real user metrics, not just synthetic tests)
3. Understand usage patterns (when, where, and how users experience slowness)
4. Assess business impact (how performance affects conversion, engagement, or revenue)

**Phase 2: Impact Analysis**
- What specific user actions or workflows are affected?
- How does current performance impact business metrics?
- Where do users actually experience slowness in their journey?
- What's the cost of poor performance vs. cost of optimization?

**Phase 3: Performance Priority Assessment**
- **User Impact**: How many users experience the performance issue
- **Business Impact**: Effect on conversion, retention, or revenue
- **Optimization Effort**: Complexity and time required for improvement
- **Improvement Potential**: How much performance gain is realistically achievable

#### Quick Filter
Skip complex optimization if all true:
- Performance issue affects very few users
- Current performance meets business requirements
- High optimization effort for minimal user-perceivable improvement
- Other higher-impact performance issues exist
→ **Document as acceptable performance debt** in `performance-debt.md`

#### Performance Priority Matrix
| User Impact | Business Impact | Optimization Effort | Priority |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
