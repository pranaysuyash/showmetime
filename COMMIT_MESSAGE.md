# Mobile Usability and Accessibility Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This commit addresses critical mobile usability issues and enhances accessibility in the TimeLab application:

### 1. Enhanced Mobile Touch Interaction
- Added invisible but larger touch target areas around clock hands:
  - Hour hand: 40px touch target (vs 8px visible hand)
  - Minute hand: 30px touch target (vs 6px visible hand)
  - Second hand: 20px touch target (vs 2px visible hand)
- Implemented visual feedback for touch targets
- Added subtle snap animation when hands land on exact positions
- Wrapped drag handling in requestAnimationFrame for smoother performance

### 2. Always-Visible Read-Aloud Control
- Added floating speaker button next to digital clock display
- Available in both Normal and Interactive modes
- Consistent 40px circular button with hover effects
- Proper ARIA labels for accessibility

### 3. Realistic Snap Mode Behavior
- Hour hand now moves gradually as minutes advance
- At 6:30, hour hand is exactly halfway between 6 and 7
- Subtle snap feedback animation when hands land on positions

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Wrapped drag move handling in requestAnimationFrame for smoother animation
- Optimized touch event handling
- Reduced unnecessary DOM manipulations during dragging

## Impact

These changes significantly improve the mobile user experience for children learning to tell time, making the application much more usable on touch devices while maintaining its educational value. The always-visible read aloud control also improves accessibility for users with visual impairments.
