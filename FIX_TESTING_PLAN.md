# TimeLab - Fix Verification Test Plan
## Testing the Hour Hand Alignment and Hand Interference Fixes

### Test 1: Hour Hand Alignment in Snapped Mode
**Objective**: Verify that the hour hand aligns exactly with the hour number when the minute hand is at 12.

**Steps**:
1. Switch to Interactive mode
2. Set drag mode to "Snapped"
3. Drag the minute hand to exactly 12 o'clock position (0 minutes)
4. Drag the minute hand to exactly 3 o'clock position (15 minutes)
5. Drag the minute hand to exactly 6 o'clock position (30 minutes)
6. Drag the minute hand to exactly 9 o'clock position (45 minutes)

**Expected Results**:
- At 0 minutes: Hour hand should be exactly on the hour number
- At 15 minutes: Hour hand should be 1/4 way between current and next hour
- At 30 minutes: Hour hand should be exactly halfway between current and next hour
- At 45 minutes: Hour hand should be 3/4 way between current and next hour

### Test 2: Hour Hand Alignment with Seconds
**Objective**: Verify that the hour hand aligns correctly when seconds are involved.

**Steps**:
1. Switch to Interactive mode
2. Set drag mode to "Snapped"
3. Set time to 3:00:00
4. Set time to 3:00:30
5. Set time to 3:30:00
6. Set time to 3:30:30

**Expected Results**:
- At 3:00:00: Hour hand exactly on 3
- At 3:00:30: Hour hand slightly past 3 (due to 30 seconds)
- At 3:30:00: Hour hand exactly halfway between 3 and 4
- At 3:30:30: Hour hand slightly past halfway (due to 30 seconds)

### Test 3: Hand Interference Resolution
**Objective**: Verify that when hands overlap, the correct hand is dragged.

**Steps**:
1. Switch to Interactive mode
2. Set drag mode to "Snapped" or "Independent"
3. Set time to 12:00:00 (all hands overlap at 12)
4. Try to drag the hour hand
5. Try to drag the minute hand
6. Try to drag the second hand

**Expected Results**:
- Each hand should be draggable independently
- No interference between hands when dragging
- Visual feedback should clearly indicate which hand is being dragged

### Test 4: Touch Target Sizes
**Objective**: Verify that touch targets are appropriately sized and don't overlap excessively.

**Steps**:
1. Switch to Interactive mode on a mobile device
2. Try dragging each hand from various positions around the visible hand
3. Try dragging hands when they are close to each other
4. Try dragging hands when they overlap

**Expected Results**:
- Hands should be draggable from a reasonable area around the visible hand
- No excessive overlap of touch targets causing confusion
- Smooth dragging experience without jumping between hands

### Test 5: Snap Mode Behavior Consistency
**Objective**: Verify that snap mode behaves consistently across different scenarios.

**Steps**:
1. Switch to Interactive mode
2. Set drag mode to "Snapped"
3. Drag minute hand from 20 minutes to 12 minutes
4. Verify hour hand alignment at 12 minutes
5. Drag minute hand from 12 minutes to 20 minutes
6. Verify hour hand position

**Expected Results**:
- Hour hand should align exactly when minute is at 12
- Hour hand should move gradually as minute changes
- Behavior should be consistent in both directions

### Test 6: Performance with Fixes
**Objective**: Verify that the fixes don't negatively impact performance.

**Steps**:
1. Switch to Interactive mode
2. Rapidly drag hands in both snapped and independent modes
3. Monitor for any lag or stuttering
4. Test on both desktop and mobile devices

**Expected Results**:
- Smooth 60fps animation maintained
- No performance degradation from the fixes
- Responsive touch interactions

### Test 7: Edge Cases
**Objective**: Verify correct behavior in edge cases.

**Steps**:
1. Switch to Interactive mode
2. Set drag mode to "Snapped"
3. Drag hands near 12 o'clock position
4. Test rapid back-and-forth dragging
5. Test dragging with very small movements
6. Test at boundary hours (11→12, 23→0, 12→1)

**Expected Results**:
- Correct handling of 12 o'clock transitions
- No jumping or incorrect snapping
- Proper hour boundary handling

### Test 8: Regression Testing
**Objective**: Verify that existing functionality still works correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Test all modes (Normal, Interactive, Learn, Quiz)
2. Test all themes
3. Test timezone functionality
4. Test digital display toggling
5. Test read aloud functionality
6. Test settings persistence

**Expected Results**:
- All existing functionality works as before
- No breaking changes introduced
- Settings properly saved and restored
