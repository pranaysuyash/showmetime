- [ ] Export Lighthouse reports (mobile/desktop) and Core Web Vitals field metrics if available

2) Code Review
- [x] Read `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, and docs for tracking/compliance
- [x] Annotate findings with references to specific lines/sections

3) Functional Testing
- [ ] Run through each mode and record defects/UX issues

4) Compliance & Analytics
- [x] Verify CMP → GA4/AdSense consent propagation

5) Report & Prioritization
- [x] Produce `REVIEW_REPORT.md` with:
  - Findings per category
  - Severity, impact, and recommended fix
  - Effort estimates and priority

6) Follow-up Tasks
- [ ] Create granular issues/tasks from the report with acceptance criteria

## Relevant Files

- `index.html` — Main app shell, meta, consent, GA4, AdSense, Clarity integration
- `styles.css` — Theming, layout, responsive/touch styles
- `script.js` — Clock rendering, modes, state, events, speech, storage

## Detailed Task Breakdown from Mobile Testing & Feature Review

*Added: 2025-08-15 - Based on mobile testing feedback and feature roadmap*

### Issues (Bugs/UX Problems)

#### Mobile Touch Interaction Issues
- [x] **Unintuitive Drag on Mobile**: Touch devices have difficulty initiating clock-hand drags
  - Problem: Draggable area is too small (just thin hand SVG), unclear where to press
  - Evidence: Small "drag circle" indicators exist but users don't notice clear handles
  - Fix: Implement larger touch targets or obvious drag handles for phones
  - Priority: High (critical usability bug)

- [x] **Laggy Drag Performance**: Clock hand dragging not smooth on mobile devices
  - Problem: Not achieving intended 60fps for smooth animation on older Android phones
  - Evidence: Users report sluggish/delayed hand movement during dragging
  - Fix: Optimize touch event handling and simplify drag logic
  - Priority: High (performance issue affecting core functionality)

### Improvements (Enhancements to Existing Features)

#### Accessibility & Visibility Enhancements
- [x] **Always-Visible Read-Aloud Control**: Make "Read time aloud" feature more accessible
  - Current: Speak button buried in Interactive mode settings panel (overlays clock on mobile)
  - Improvement: Add permanent small speaker icon next to digital clock display
  - Scope: Available in both Normal and Interactive modes
  - Benefit: Better accessibility without leaving/obscuring clock view

- [x] **Better Touch Target & Feedback**: Enhance touch targets for dragging
  - Current: 44px minimum touch target design but clock hands are thin and hard to grab
  - Improvement: Enlarge invisible clickable area around hands or add tappable knobs
  - Add: Clearer visual cues (highlight hand, show grab cursor) when finger is positioned
  - Result: Much easier and more reliable dragging on phones

#### Cross-Platform Consistency
- [ ] **Cross-Device Testing & Tweaks**: Comprehensive testing across devices
  - Test: Android and iPhone variants for device-specific issues
  - Verify: Touch events on iOS (passive events, 3D Touch handling)
  - Ensure: Audio read-out works across browsers
  - Address: Scrolling interference during drag, iOS audio interaction requirements
  - Goal: Consistently polished experience on all mobile platforms

- [x] **Snap Mode Realism**: Refine "snapped" drag mode for authenticity
  - Current: Hour/minute hands link correctly but hour moves chunkily
  - Implement: Gradual hour-hand movement as minutes advance (e.g., 6:30 = halfway between numbers)
  - Add: Subtle snap feedback (magnetic pull or click sound when landing on numbers)
  - Benefit: More realistic clock behavior for educational value

### New Features (Planned Additions)

#### World Time Features
- [ ] **Interactive World Time Map**: 2D map view for exploring time zones
  - Technology: Leaflet library for map display
  - Features: Tap locations to see local time, time zone boundaries, day/night regions
  - Tools: Search function for cities, time-zone converter between locations
  - Educational: Powerful learning addition for global time awareness

- [ ] **3D Globe Time Viewer**: Immersive world time using Three.js
  - Technology: WebGL-based 3D Earth with realistic lighting
  - Features: Rotate/zoom globe, real-time day/night areas, city markers with local times
  - Interaction: Spin to city or "fly" to locations via interactive list
  - Showcase: Advanced WebGL technology demonstration

#### Interactive Learning
- [ ] **Educational Games Mode**: Complete the placeholder Games section
  - Current: Hidden with dummy content
  - Implement: Three mini-games planned
    - Race the Clock: Set time as fast as possible
    - Time Detective: Match daily activities to times
    - Time Memory: Memory matching of clock faces
  - Goal: Fun, interactive practice and increased engagement

- [ ] **Voice Command Interaction**: Add speech recognition for clock control
  - Commands: "Set the clock to 3:30", "What time is it in Tokyo?"
  - Technology: Web Speech API for recognition
  - Integration: Works with existing text-to-speech output
  - Benefit: Hands-free accessibility and new interactive modality

### Technical Enhancements

#### Performance Optimizations
- [x] Review and optimize animation loops for consistent 60fps across devices
- [x] Implement touch event optimization for mobile drag interactions
- [ ] Add device-specific performance adaptations

#### Accessibility Improvements
- [ ] Enhance voice control integration
- [ ] Improve screen reader compatibility for interactive elements
- [ ] Add high contrast mode options
